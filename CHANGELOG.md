## [0.0.1.0] - 2026-04-09

### Security
- Restrict CORS to explicit origins in production via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var
  (`docker-compose.prod.yml` sets it to `https://${CADDY_HOST}` at deploy time)
- `allow_credentials` is now disabled when origins is wildcard, which is invalid
  per the CORS spec and was previously a misconfiguration in local dev
- Startup warning logged when wildcard CORS is active so accidental production
  deployments are visible in logs

### Added
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable in `backend/app/config.py`; defaults to
  `"*"` so `docker compose up` requires no env changes
- `parse_allowed_origins()` helper in `config.py` — shared by `main.py` and tests
- 8 CORS behavior tests in `backend/tests/test_cors.py` covering wildcard, allowed
  origin, rejected origin, preflight, multi-origin list, empty origins, and negative
  cases

### Fixed
- CORS origin parser now strips trailing slashes to prevent silent mismatches
  (e.g. `https://example.com/` vs `https://example.com`)
- `allow_credentials` guard handles empty origin list correctly
